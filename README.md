## Cool and Smooth \- Access/Excel Charting Demo


</div>

### Description

This VBA Automation demonstration assumes that Microsoft Excel 97 and Access 97 are installed. It hasn't been tested yet with Office 2000. My work required an Excel application that could generate charts based on information in Access. After searching PSC I came upon a great example by Joe Miquel which I've built upon. Once you've started the application all you will need to do is Click on the Excel Button on the Access Form. Feel free to expand and to innovate the code. Many thanks to PSC and to Joe Miguel for a great idea. Hope you like it.
 
### More Info
 
Requires Excel and Access 97. Depends on a reference to the Excel Object in Access. Best viewed on a monitor with 1028 x 768 resolution.
